### Hi there I'm Caro 👋

My goal is to explain artificial intelligence (AI) in an understandable way and make it accessible to as many people as possible. 🌍 <br>
Therefore my team and me create workshops, online programming tutorials and education material on critical thinking as well as the impact of AI on the social level.

Although the GitHub repos I am working on are private you can see cool stuff we have developed here: [**KI-Kurs**](http:www.ki-kurs.org)

Implemented:
<br>✔️ Python fundamentals course,
<br>✔️ programming tutorial on image recognition with CNNs
<br>✔️ tutorial on neural nets 
<br>✔️ programming task pool
<br>✔️ AI definition mind-map
<br>✔️ AI applications and their effect on society

In progress:
<br> ⏰ introduction to machine learning 
<br> ⏰ critical thinking about AI
<br> ⏰ memory game on historical milestones of AI

Currently our platform is only available in German language.
