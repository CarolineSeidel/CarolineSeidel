### Hi there I'm Caro 👋

I have a Masters in Industrial and Organizational Psychology and focus on learning and development, e-learning, training design and talent management. My goal is to explain artificial intelligence (AI) in an understandable way and make it accessible to as many people as possible. 🌍 Durig my time at the Tübingen AI Center I created workshops, online programming tutorials and education material on critical thinking as well as the impact of AI on the social level.

Although the GitHub repos I am working on are private you can see cool stuff we have developed here: [**KI-Kurs**](http:www.ki-kurs.org)

Implemented:
<br>✔️ Python fundamentals course,
<br>✔️ programming tutorial on image recognition with CNNs
<br>✔️ tutorial on neural nets 
<br>✔️ programming task pool
<br>✔️ AI definition mind-map
<br>✔️ AI applications and their effect on society
<br>✔️ ethical thinking about AI

In progress:
<br>⏰ introduction to machine learning 
<br>⏰ memory game on historical milestones of AI

Currently our platform is only available in German - we are working on that! 😉
